# When users post an update on social media,such as a URL, image, status
#  update etc., other users in their network are able to view this new post on 
#  their news feed. Users can also see exactly when the post was published, i.e, how many hours, minutes or seconds ago.
# Since sometimes posts are published and viewed in different time zones, this 



# N = int(input(":"))
# D = input().split()
# K = int(input(":"))


# from itertools import combinations

# contain = 0
# total = 0

# for c in combinations(D, K):
#     if "a" in c:
#         contain += 1
#     total += 1
# print(contain/total)
